If you've ever played the not-necessarily-drinking game that consists of everyone contributing word by word to create a story, you may appreciate this. 
I thought it'd be interesting to observe that same effect online with the hypothesis that the result would be 10x more hillarious. Therefore, I spent a couple of weeks making [Short Story Long](http://sstorylong.com). As you will see, it didn't turn out as I expected. Apart from playing, make sure to read through the archive.
